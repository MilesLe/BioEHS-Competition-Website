# BioEHS-Competition-Website
This is a final project for PHS Web Dev course 2018-19.

This website represents my work as the leader of my high schools bioengineering competition teams competing in UC Berkeleys High School BioEHS compeitions.

To run the website, open the file named "opener.html" first.
