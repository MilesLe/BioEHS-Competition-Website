# Web_Dev_Personal_Project_2
This is a final project for PHS Web Dev course 2018-19.

This reversion should...
- have the navigation be consisting of a list, not a bunch of hyperlinks. 
- You may want to redo parts of the website with Bootstrap.
- Also fix the voting system.Actually, instead just move the vote to the other page. 

To run the website, open the file named "opener.html" first.
